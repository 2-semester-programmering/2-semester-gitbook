# My First Website

After creating an empty new Spring project in IntelliJ through the _Spring Initializer Template,_ you should now create your first _Hello World Website_.

_Remember that this is a step by step instruction. It does not explain all the concepts in details. This explanation you will get from your teacher in class._

You should now have a folder and file structure that looks something like this:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2017-11-17 at 10.58.46.png>)

If you open your _**src**_ folder you will see a _**main**_ and a _**test**_ folder.\
Delete the:

* _**test**_ folder\
  And delete the:
* _**mvnw**_ and the _**mvnw.cmd**_ files.

(you could leave them in the project, but since we are not going to use them we delete them for a better overview)

Now you have a project structure that looks like this:

#### Create an index method in the class

Create a public method called index with a return type of String, and return the string "Hello World".

Add _**@RestController**_ above the class definition and _**@GetMapping("/")**_ above the method definition. As a return value you could write "Hello World" or something else of your own choice.&#x20;
