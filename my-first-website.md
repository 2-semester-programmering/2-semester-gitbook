# My First Website

After creating an empty new Spring project in IntelliJ through the _Spring Initializer Template_: [#3 Hello Spring](https://github.com/StudentsAdministration/03\_hello\_spring), you should now create your first _Hello World Website_.

_Remember that this is a step by step instruction. It does not explain all the concepts in details. This explanaition you will get from your teacher in class._

You should now have a folder and file structure that looks something like this:

If you open your _**src**_ folder you will see a _**main**_ and a _**test**_ folder.\
Delete the:

* _**test**_ folder\
  And delete the:
* _**mvnw**_ and the _**mvnw.cmd**_ files.

(you could leave them in the project, but since we are not going to use them we delete them for a better overview)

Now you have a project structure that looks like this:
